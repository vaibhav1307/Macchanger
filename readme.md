WARNING - I AM NOT ENCOURAGING YOU FROM ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES .DO ANYTHING WITH A PRIOR CONSENT OF A PERSON.JUST FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.

THIS WILL ONLY WORK IF YOU ARE USING wlan0 AS THE YOUR NETWORK INTERFACE
OR YOU CAN EDIT THE SCRIPT AND TYPE YOUR NETWORK INTERFCACE(eth0 or other) IN PLACE OF wlan0
 

these script are for changing your mac address which provides you more anonymity . Its an important step cause if you try to dos
or crack someones wifi then if the owner calls security to inspect the router then it will have your mac address and the person can
verify if he has a suspicion on you . So it becomes necessary for you to change your macaddress.

we have made two scripts i.e mac_start and mac_stop
so as it is clear by the name the first one is to change the mac address and the second one is to revert the changes back to your
permanent maccadress

TO USE :
go wherever you have saved these scripts , open in terminal there and write
chmod +x mac_start 
./mac_start
this will changer your maccadress to a random one

to revert this back to normal
chmod +x mac_stop
./mac_stop

this will revert the maccadress back to permanent one.


YOU DONT GOTTA DONATE FOR THIS ONE . IM NOT GREEDY !! 
THANKS!
